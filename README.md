Flabby bird style game

Files:
game.html
player.js
barrier.js 

Basic Working:
When space increase player height by 10 

If touching barrier end game

If go through gap increase score by 1 

UPDATE:
Increase level of diffuculty with pipes , aliging both top and bottom pipes. Ended up drawing two seperate pipes, with both talking to each other along with using math.random to create random lengths as well as a math random function to deterime the gap between the two pipes.
